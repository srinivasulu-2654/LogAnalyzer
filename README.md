# LogAnalyzer

🔍 **LogAnalyzer** is a Python-based tool that extracts and categorizes logs based on severity levels such as `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL`. It helps in filtering system logs efficiently.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Automatically detects system logs (`/var/log/syslog` for Linux or `sample.log` for Windows).
- ✅ Extracts logs based on severity levels.
- ✅ Saves categorized logs into separate files (`info_logs.txt`, `error_logs.txt`, etc.).
- ✅ Adds timestamps to logs for better tracking.
